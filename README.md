## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.
There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

In this project, a javascript code is written to create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. Users are allowed to filter the table data for specific values. 

## Task
Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
* Create a basic HTML index web page
* Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, appends a table to the web page and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
